Why Public Chain should optimize grant distribution for "good public goods"
This memo summarizes the "grants" that Public Chain and Dapps are implementing from an administrative perspective. In this article, I will particularly focus on Public Chain's creation of an ecosystem, what is governance? I will write about the following.

Public chain is like a goverment.
- The "goverment" here does not have to have the land itself.
- What is important is that the development of the ecosystem itself is an incentive for those who create the goverment!
- Services that do not directly produce money but are used by many people = public goods are important for the public chain to develop the ecosystem.

There are many examples of countries (like the US, China, Japan) investing in their ecosystems. Education, healthcare, jobs, etc. Basic welfare services may seem like a drip-drip-drip in the short term, but they are implemented because they are investments that will pay off in the medium to long term.

As for the "public chain and the goverment being similar," the reason is that when a commercial transaction (in the case of crypto, you say "transaction") occurs within the ecosystem, it can force the collection of taxes. For the public chain, smart contracts have the power to enforce, and for the goverment, it has its own police force and military, and the law is the law largely because of this violent apparatus.
(You should be able to understand this story if you read the Social Contract Theory.)

(If you think about it, don't you think that the public chain and the goverment are similar?
Next, I will write about [How to distribute grants to "good public goods"]().
