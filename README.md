# Soulbound-Graph

A social graph protocol for distributing Grants to public goods that are supported by a wide community. The current Quadratic Funding is vulnerable to collusion, but this is an experimental effort to generate a social graph based on SBTs and wallet transactions, and to establish a Plural Identity based on "how distributed the supporters are".
